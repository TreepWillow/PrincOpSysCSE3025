Difficulties:

The most challenging part of the lab I worked on was getting the valid
output for execises. For clarification, either the processes would end
to early and not be outputed when running ps or the process delay ps
process and will wait until the child processes finish execution then
print the remaining processes.

In order to resolve this, I would either have to run ps in tandem with
the test programs: lab3test3 &; ps. Another solution would be to
change the processes nice value on run time so that they don't take
priority over the ps program.

Managing the priorities was the most confusing of the lab. Otherwise,
the remaining exercises were fairly straightforward as while my
partern, Peter, focused on the first half of the lab, I worked on the
second half.

Lab3test2 was not very different compared to the orginal say for a few
new lines of code implemented but an entirely new test file was
created to properly show the priority scheduling as it executes.
