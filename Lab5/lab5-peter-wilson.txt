Difficulties:
- E1: refmgr is never defined. Is it supposed to be a structure name like kmem is?
    - Defined the structure. Can be better if it is consolidated into kmem
- E1: Question: does return 0 kill the process when running vmfault()
- E1: The PTE_COW flag is being used for dertrminig if a page is COW but the Lab says to use PTE_RSW
- E1: There are more than one definition for kref_inc and kref_dec in kalloc.c. Is this intentional?
- E1: Question: is the lab section for copyout() asking us to have copyout() allocate a new page when it finds a COW or that it should return -1 if the page is not already newly allocated?
- E1: make file error make: *** No rule to make target 'mkfs/mkfs.c', needed by 'mkfs/mkfs'.  Stop.
    - removed mkfs from .gitignore file
    - The lab in the repo got corrupted and removed files so we had to reclone the xv6 and migrate the code.
- E1: usertrap is causing a panic:
    usertrap(): unexpected scause 0xf pid=3
                sepc=0x854 stval=0x4f88
    usertrap(): unexpected scause 0xf pid=2
                sepc=0x2 stval=0x4f88
    usertrap(): unexpected scause 0xf pid=1
                sepc=0x77a stval=0x3f68
    panic: init exiting

How to make a syscall
- in User add a .c file
- In makeFile add in UPROGS the .c file name
- in user.h add prototype
- in usys.pl add entry
- in syscall.h add a #define for the syscall
- in sysproc.c add the syscall code
- in syscall.c add syscall to array and prototype
- edit other files if needed (like proc.c when kfork needs to be edited or proc.h when you need to add a varible)
