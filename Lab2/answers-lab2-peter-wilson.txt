Q1: 0x0

Q2: a7 = 0xf and represents the syscall number

Q3: 
sstatus = 0x200000000 when first running OS
sstatus = 0x200000022 when right before p->trapframe->a7 and after


Q4:
scause=0xd sepc=0x80002842 stval=0x0
panic: kerneltrap

num = * (int *) 0; // Just changed from p->trapframe->a7; * (int *) 0;
80002842:	00002683          	lw	a3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>

the instruction is load word (ld) and the register used for num is a3

Q5:
The kernel is crashing becuase lw is trying to load from physical address 0.
0 is not mapped in the kernel address space
yes scause does confirm

Q6:
init is the process' name
the pid is 0x1 or 1
