Difficulties:
- E1: had trouble getting the 2 windowed gdb to work
- E1: gdb not working anymore after having it working
    - I was typing kernel as kernal
- E2: user.h was giving me error with uint instead of unsigned int so I switched them and it worked
- E2: my syscall was erroring becuase I did not add a line to the prototypes

- E3: trying to find out how to get a specific process
    - used kkill as example code to loop through all processes
- E3: When I am runnig the test for get and set it is causing the kernel to panic
