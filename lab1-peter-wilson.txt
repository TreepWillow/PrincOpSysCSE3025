TOTAL: 6:25

Difficulties:
- E1 libraries
- E2 flag combo question
- E2 getting strcmp to work (give a 0 when same)
- E2 understanding how to get | input to work. need to read from stdin which is file descriptor 0.
- E2 Pipe functionality caused function to not work
- E3 the printf happens at the same time when both parent and child are printing
- E3 Having the processes wait for each other rather than just taking the message that it just sent
- E3 Process Id increments during the same OS session when repeating the command (might not be a bug)

Summary
- E1: E1 was rather simple the only hard part was understanding how to initially get a program to work which was pretty simple other than not knowing that you needed the custom libraries and not the standard C libraries.
- E2: E2 was a bit harder and brought a couple of questions to the table such as what combinations are needed to be implemented when making this command. I asked on the CS discord but got no reply so I assumed that it would just be wc_new <flags of any combination> <Files>. When making the code I wanted to use strcmp but forgot that it returned 0 when it worked and not 1 so that was annoying. The hardest part was figuring out how the | worked. I managed to figure out that it passes to stdin which is the file descriptor of 0 and that helped me implement it.
- E3: E3 was medium difficulty with the hardest part mostly being understanding the synced execution of the processes and the need for the parent process to not instantly take the message out of the read fd before the child can read it. I also encountered a possible bug but I am not sure if it is a bug but the Process Id increments during the same OS session when repeating the command.
